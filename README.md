# AnonymizationTool
The anonymization app deletes personal data from .fcs/.lmd files. In the process, the entered file is overwritten in the affected areas or field contents are deleted. This enables the further use of the anonymized file for physicians and doctors. 

## Installation
Install the package by using Github
> remotes::install_github("JonasSchulz-Marner/AnonymizationTool")

## Manual
The full manual for physicians, doctors and scientists who have .fcs/.lmds for anonymization, is available here: update link
