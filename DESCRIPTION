Description: AnonymizationTool for anonymizing personal data from FCS and LMD files.
    The package uses a Shiny App to anonymize all personal data, that 
    is find in a FCS or LMD file.  Anonymization is performed using predetermined
    keywords that indicate personal data. These are filtered out by the anonymization 
    app and the corresponding content is overwritten with a string of "X". Thus, 
    |SampleID1|Max Mustermann| -> |SampleID1|XXXXXXXXXX| 
    Then a copy of the file is returned so the original file remains unchanged.
